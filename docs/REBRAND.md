# Rebrand Notice — Aegis Slicer → LibreSlicer

**Effective date:** October 28, 2025  
**Project:** LibreSlicer (formerly Aegis Slicer)  
**Website:** https://libreslicer.org

## Why we renamed
“LibreSlicer” states our values in the name: creator-first, open core (AGPLv3), and no telemetry. Same code lineage, same team—clearer direction.

## What changed (and what didn’t)
- **Changed:** Name, website domain, on-page branding, release tags, docs.
- **Unchanged:** License (AGPLv3 for the Supporter Build), funding model (Transparent Commons), and clean-room Hephaestus Pro track.

## Timeline
- **Oct 28, 2025:** Public rebrand; banner + news post; repo docs updated.
- **Oct 28–Nov 30, 2025:** 301 redirects active; “formerly Aegis Slicer” note visible.
- **Nov 3–9, 2025:** Transparency Patch #1 includes rebrand ledger entry.

## Repository & releases
We are **keeping the current repo slug** for continuity (GitHub auto-redirects are reliable if we later rename). New releases will use `libreslicer-vX.Y.Z` tags.

## Redirects & mapping
All legacy `aegisslicer.org` links 301 to `libreslicer.org`.  
Slug-by-slug mapping lives here:


Add one per line: <old-path> -> <new-path> 301

/news -> /news 301
/press -> /news 301
/faq -> /faq 301
/roadmap -> /roadmap 301
/ledger -> /ledger 301
/aegis -> /about 301


> If you find a broken link, please open an issue or email support@libreslicer.org.

## Legal & compliance
- Supporter Build remains AGPLv3 with **SOURCE_OFFER** included in every release bundle.
- **NOTICE** updated to reflect the new project name while preserving historical credits.
- No telemetry at launch; diagnostics remain optional/opt-in in a later version.
