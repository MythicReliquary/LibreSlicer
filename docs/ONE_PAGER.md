# LibreSlicer One-Pager

**Version:** 2025-10-28 · Maintainer: Mythic Reliquary LLC

## What LibreSlicer Delivers
- Creator-first SLA/resin slicer derived from the proven PrusaSlicer engine.
- No telemetry, no vendor lock-in—everything ships under the GNU AGPLv3.
- Clean, predictable releases with matching source archives and compliance docs.

## Who It Serves
- Indie makers and small studios that need reliable resin workflows.
- Teams migrating from proprietary slicers who value transparency.
- Contributors who want an upstream-compatible codebase without telemetry baggage.

## Product Pillars
1. **Predictable output** – validated resin profiles, deterministic slicing, reproducible builds.
2. **Stay in control** – offline mode by default, open configuration formats, scriptable CLI.
3. **Audit-friendly** – automated SOURCE_OFFER updates, third-party notices, reproducible pipelines.

## Launch Commitments (v1.0)
- Windows supporter installer (unsigned for now; SmartScreen warning expected).
- Linux: documented source build path (GTK3 default, Catch2 v3 test harness).
- Help menu trimmed to a single “LibreSlicer Website” entry while docs are rebuilt.
- Elegoo SLA profiles seeded; resin QA smoke tests run in CI.

## Next Wave (v1.1)
- Ship ready-made profiles for Qidi X Max 3 and Elegoo Mars 5 with Siraya Tech Fast Grey.
- macOS universal build + notarized disk image.
- Expanded help center content and restored in-app documentation links.
- Automation harness for simulated print environment (proprietary CLI tools).
